# BikeSharing in New York City
[Link to my tableau story](https://public.tableau.com/views/TheNYCCitiBikeStory/TheNYCStory?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Overview:
Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

### Resources: 
  - Pandas, Python  
  - Tableau Public
  - JupyterLab 
  
### Objective:

### Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format

### Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
#### The screenshots below are of all the different graphs and small details of each graph.

#### a. Below is the chart for Checkout Times for Users Viz
    -- In this visualization, is a graph of the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders.

#### b. Below is the chart for Checkout Times by Gender Viz
    -- In this visualization, is a graph of the length of time that bikes are checked out for each gender.

##### c. Below is the chart for Trips by Weekday for Each Hour Viz
    -- In this visualization, is a graph of the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap.

##### d. Below is the chart for Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) Viz
    -- In this visualization, is a graph of the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week as a heatmap.

##### e. Below is the chart for User Trips by Gender by Weekday Viz
    -- In this visualization, is a graph of the number of bike trips by gender for each hour for each day of the week as a heatmap.

### Below are the additional charts for deliverable 3.
##### f. Below is the chart for Customer Type
    -- In this visualization, is a pie chart of customer types.

##### g. Below is the chart for Bike utilization
    -- In this visualization, is a circle and size viz of bike utilization.

##### h. Below is the chart for Top Start Locations

### Summary:
  - With the visual data we were able to show that there are increasing sales numbers in mostly tourists areas such as shown in Manhattan.
  - We were able to identify which gender often uses the bikes 
  - And also showed the duration of checkouts.
  - And that sales closer to the summer time increase.

### With all of this information we can conduct and analysis that shows how this too can work in Des Moines. With the ability to gather this type of data we can use the data and show what the information can look like for the city of Des Moines. 

#### For future recommendations we could build a chart that shows sales numbers and also how often a bike is utilized to know when repairs are needed and the average cost of repairs.
